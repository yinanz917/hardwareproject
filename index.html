	<h2 id="Computer"> Computers </h2>
	<h3> What is a computer? </h3>
	<p> A computer is an electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program. It has the ability to store, retrieve and process large amounts of data quickly. </p>
	<h3> How does a computer work? </h3>
	<p> A computer takes input from the user and outputs information after processing the information and can store it in its memory. It then displays the information using a peripheral such as a monitor. The most simple language of code is called machine code, and it breaks the computer’s tasks into binary, made up of 1s and 0s. </p>
	<h3> How do the components interact? </h3>
	<p> Each component of a computer has a major part in the process of displaying the desired information or data to an output device. First, an action is completed by an input device (which are typically peripherals, such as a mouse opening a program), then a copy of the software program is transferred from the hard drive (permanent computer storage) onto the RAM (internal device memory). This is because the current software required by the CPU for processing has to be in temporary storage, the random access memory (RAM). The CPU then performs the tasks in the given order with the help of the clock. The clock gives a pulse beat to the CPU to keep instructions in order and determines the speed at which they are carried out. This prevents the system from crashing. </p>

	<h2 id="Before"> Before </h2>
	<img src="Before.jpg" alt="Inside of the system unit when it was first opened."/>
	<p> The first glance. We opened up our system unit and were able to see all the different components and connections located inside. </p>
	<p class="othertext"><a href="#Top"> Table of Contents </a></p>
	
	<h2 id="Parts"> Parts of a Computer </h2>
	<h3> The System Unit </h3>
	<img src="SystemUnit.jpg" alt="The outside appearance of the system unit provided in class."/>
	<p> A plastic or metal box that contains most of the components of the computer (excluding external peripherals). </p>
	
	<h3> Motherboard </h3>
	<img src="Motherboard.jpg" alt="The complicated motherboard."/>
	<p> It acts like the “mother” of the computer as it connects different components. The mother is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains the main components of a computer. It holds the CPU, memory chips (RAM and ROM), power connectors, and a large number of expansion slots for processors such as the video card and solid state drives. </p>
	
	<h3> CPU (Central Processing Unit) </h3>
	<p> The Central Processing Unit (a.k.a. the microprocessor) is one of the most important components in a computer. This part of the computer is responsible for completing arithmetic and logical operations and processing information from memory. It is the brain of the computer, as it can add, subtract, and compare with binary codes. Binary can be represented easily as “on” and “off” in the CPU by millions of switches called transistors. These transistors carry out the functions of the CPU in binary code. </p>
	
	<h3> Hard Drive </h3>
	<img src="HardDrive.jpg" alt="The hard drive found in the system unit."/>
	<p> The hard drive is vital for the computer to function. It is where all your data is stored permanently, unlike RAM, which is temporary. It has a hard disk inside of it where all your files are physically located. The data is stored on a stack of disks magnetically. These disks spin extremely fast so that the data can be accessed immediately. The hard drive can also be divided into directories (folders).</p>
	
	<h3> CD-ROM Drive </h3>
	<img src="CD-ROMDrive.jpg" alt="The CD-ROM drive found in the system unit."/>
	<p> The Compact Disk Read Only Memory, is a pre-pressed compact disk which stores data. Computers are able to read the stored data, however, they aren’t able to be changed, only read. The information is usually programmed into the computer during construction. For example, the CD-ROM Drive would contain the data used when the computer is turned on. </p>
	
	<h3> Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
	<img src="FloppyDiskDrive.jpg" alt="The floppy disk drive found in the system unit."/>
	<p> This component is a drive that is used for floppy disks to transfer information between computers and it also saves information on these disks. Floppy disks are inserted into the drive entrance in order for the computer to use them. Nowadays, floppy disks have become irrelevant after the invention of smaller and more efficient forms of storage, such as a USB flash drive. </p>
	
	<h3> RAM (Random Access Memory) </h3>
	<img src="RAM.jpg" alt="The RAM found on the motherboard."/>
	<p>  It is a type of memory that the operating system, applications, and data in current use are stored so that it can be accessed much faster from the CPU. RAM is faster to read and write than other forms of storage such as Hard Drives and SSDs. Data is stored in RAM as long as the computer is running, once the computer is shut down, all the data stored in the RAM is lost. It is a form of temporary storage. If data held on the RAM is to be permanently stored, it should be saved to the hard drive. </p>
	
	<h3> Sound Card </h3>
	<img src="SoundCard.jpg" alt="The sound card used to provide audio."/>
	<p> The sound card is a peripheral that is slotted on the motherboard that allows the computer the use of audio. That provides the desired audio to be outputted to a device. </p>
	
	<h3> Graphics Card (Integrated) </h3>
	<img src="GraphicsCard.jpg" alt="Two images side by side of the integrated graphics card on the motherboard."/>
	<p> The graphics card located on the motherboard is a component that converts data into graphics that are displayed on the monitor. A GPU(graphics processing unit) that is integrated into the motherboard and shares memory with the CPU. Integrated graphics are usually more economical and use less power but have far less processing power than a stand-alone GPU. </p>
	
	<h3> Cooling Fan </h3>
	<img src="CoolingFan.jpg" alt="The cooling found on top of the heatsink."/>
	<p>  It is a fan that is connected on top of the heatsink to help cool the heatsink. This component is key to maintaining the functionality of the CPU. The CPU carries millions of electrical signals every second which generates a lot of heat. The cooling fan prevents the CPU from overheating. </p>
	
	<h3> Heatsink </h3>
	<img src="Heatsink.jpg" alt="The heatsink found underneath the cooling fan on the motherboard."/>
	<p> The heatsink is a device that is attached to the CPU to cool it down by absorbing heat and dissipating it into the fan which blows it out of the case. </p>
	
	<h3> Power Supply </h3>
	<img src="PowerSupply.jpg" alt="The power supply attached to the system unit casing."/>
	<p> The power supply converts high voltage AC (alternating current) from a socket to a low voltage DC (direct current) to power the computer. All components of the computer are only able to run using DC power. The voltage size it converts to depends on the component and the amount of power it requires. </p>

	<h2 id="After"> After </h2>
	<img src="After.jpg" alt="The empty system unit case after we took it apart."/>
	<p> After taking all the important components out, we were left with the metal casing of the system unit. With the exceptions of cables and wire connected to the power supply that was fixed to the case. </p>
	<p class="othertext"><a href="#Top"> Back to the Top </a></p>
	
	<h2 id="Final"> Reassembling </h2>
	<img src="Final.jpg" alt="An image of the system unit after we put back all the components."/>
	<p> After examining and removing the components, we documented and took photos of each part. The final step was to put it all back together in working condition. As you can see, we reassembled it to its original form we found it in when first opened. </p>
